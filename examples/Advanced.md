# Advanced example on how to use this Action
In this example we deploy 2 templates (for the sake of the example the same template) but the second one depends on the first one as we need first the output of first one and second we need to override a parameter in the second template.   
Our template has two outputs `location` and `containerName`. But we are only interested in `containerName`, the first template will output that one and the second one requires that and appends `-overriden` so we can see it got overriden.

## Steps
```yaml
- uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
  id: deploy
  with:
    scope: resourcegroup
    resourceGroupName: azurearmaction
    template: examples/template/template.json
    parameters: examples/template/parameters.json
    deploymentName: github-advanced-test
```
Here we see a normal use of the Action, we pass the template as json file as well as the parameters. If we look into the `template.json` File we can see at the very bottom the defined outputs:
```json
{
  ...
  "outputs": {
    ...
    "containerName": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "[parameters('containerName')]"
    }
  }
}
```
And we know our Action writes this output(s) to an action output variable with the same name, we can access it using `${{ steps.deploy.outputs.containerName }}` (Note: `deploy` comes from the `id` field from above.)   

If we now add a Shell script with a simple echo from that value,
```yaml
- run: echo ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.containerName }}
```
we can see that on the console will be `github-action` printed.

Now we add our second deployment which relies on that value and modfies the `containerName` parameter,
```yaml
- uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
  id: deploy2
  with:
    scope: resourcegroup
    resourceGroupName: azurearmaction
    template: examples/template/template.json
    parameters: examples/template/parameters.json containerName=${{ steps.deploy.outputs.containerName }}-overriden
    deploymentName: github-advanced-test  
```
Look at the `parameters` section, where we plug in another `parameter.json` File and we pass in line seperated key-value pairs as overrides. If we now add again a shell script to see our ouput,
```yaml
- run: echo ${{ steps.deploy2.outputs.containerName }}
```
we can see that on the console will be `github-action-overriden` printed.
